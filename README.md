# UFO-js

In this assignment, I displayed data of UFO sightings on a webpage. I then used D3 and Javascript to build functionality for filtering the data on several attributes. This is accomplished by clicking the "Show More Filters" button, which causes additional filters to appear. To even further improve user experience, I added a "Reset Filters" button which clears all existing filter input and displays all data with no filters applied.

## Prerequisites
